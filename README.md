Nihil Ace
=========

A block-based space shooter by pennomi

# Overview
Right now, Nihil Ace is in its infancy; there's no menus, respawning,
construction, etc. I currently consider it a tech demo showing what I
eventually hope to accomplish.

# Installation
See the INSTALL file for details.

# Running the game
Once you've installed all the dependencies, you can run the game by typing:

    python main.py

This command also accepts arguments `nosound`, `nogldebug`, and `profile`.

# Contributing
I'd love for people to like this game enough to contribute! Note that all my
code is MIT licensed, so any contributions would have to be compatible.

More than code at this point, I need strong art direction. If you're an artist,
I'd definitely love help!
